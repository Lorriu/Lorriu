With over 10 years of experience as a Professional Olympic Athlete, I have consistently strived for excellence, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in my field. This commitment to success led me to achieve two World Championships Bronze medals and a spot in the Olympic Finals.

My journey took an unexpected turn when I discovered a passion for coding. I embarked on an introductory coding course out of curiosity, and I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I embraced this new challenge. I found immense joy in acquiring new skills and tackling complex problems to create innovative digital products. My fascination with technology, which had always lingered in the background, suddenly took center stage.

As a professional athlete, I dedicated countless hours to perfecting my craft, honing my skills, and learning continuously to be the best in my sport. Transitioning into the corporate world, I realized that the same principles I applied to my athletic career were highly applicable to my new role as a software engineer. Hard work, resilience in the face of coding challenges, hours of practice and learning, goal-setting, and finding purpose in my work have been instrumental in my growth as a tech engineer.

My unique journey from the world of athletics to software engineering equips me with a strong work ethic, solid determination, and a hunger for continuous improvement. I am excited to bring this athlete's mindset into my coding career, where I am committed to delivering excellence and driving innovation.
